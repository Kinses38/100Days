# 100Days
### Why
I'm taking part in the 100 days of code challenge to help me build confidence in coding interviews, 
learn new things, and make a start on some projects which that I've been putting off. 

### What I'll be doing
To start off I'll be practing coding interview questions, data structures, algorithms, etc on the likes of HackerRank, CodeWars and others.
I'll add more as I go, the main thing is to make a start to the commitment!

### Languages/Tech Stack
For now I'll be working in Java and changing it up depending how I progress and what I'm working on.

### Git
In terms of git workflow, I will be following using a feature branch for all additions to this repo.
